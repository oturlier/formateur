= Reference Sections in a Page



== Reference a section in the same page

//TODO: Test if you can use a section title as an id when publishing pdf
// ----
//  This is an in-page cross reference: <<Reference a section in the same page>>.
// ----

// Section title IDs are automatically generated when AsciiDoc pages are processed, so you can use them as links by referencing the section’s title.
//However, the title must begin with an uppercase letter (in basic Latin) without any leading formatting marks.

To create an in-page xref to a section use the section’s implicit ID.

For example:

[#create-id]
.Create an explicit ID
----
[#reference-a-section-in-the-same-page]
= Reference a Section in the Same Page

Blah blah blah...
----

[#link-to-id]
.Link to an Explicit ID in the same page
----
This is an in-page cross reference:
<<reference-a-section-in-the-same-page,Check it out>>!
----

You can also create in-line ids.

.Create an Inline ID
----
This is an [#name-me] inline ID.

For more information <<name-me, see example>>.
----

[TIP]
====
We prefer to use the shorthand ID version for defining anchors within a document.

[#some-id]
